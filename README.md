# 15-Puzzle-Game
 In 15 puzzle, we have 4X4 board with numbers from 1 to 15. One piece is blank. Using the event button keys, the numbered pieces can be moved around if the movement is valid (in horizontal or vertical direction, and adjacent to blank piece, and within board only) 

How do you play this game: Initially 1..15 and a blank are shown in order. The challenger (a human) moves the pieces around and then asks the solver to bring them back  in order to original position.
